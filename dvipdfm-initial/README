   This is dvipdfm, a DVI to PDF translator.  
   
   Features:
      - TeX \special's that approximate the functionality 
        of the PostScript pdfmarks used by Adobe's
	Acrobat Distiller.  Links, outlines, articles, and named
	destinations are supported, for example.
	
      - Ability to include PDF files and JPEG files
        as embedded images.

      - Beginning of page (BOP) and end of page (EOP)
        \special's for placing arbitrary PDF stream
	graphics on every page.

      - A color stack accessible via specials (this
        should help people wanting to write packages for
	this driver).
	
      - Works great on plain old DVI files.

   Limitations:

      - No Virtual font support in this version. This means that the
	"times", "palatino", and similar packages that require virtual
	fonts will not work correctly.  Work is in progress and
	this should be supported soon. 

      - No output PDF stream compression.  Input PDF files
        may be contain compressed streams, however.
        Flate compression of PDF output streams will be
	supported in a future version.
	
      - No package support yet.  Graphics can be included
        via \special's, but there is no \includegraphics
	support, for example.
