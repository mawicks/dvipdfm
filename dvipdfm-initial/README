   This is dvipdfm, a DVI to PDF translator.  I wrote this mainly as
exercise to get at the features of PDF I wanted to experiment with. You're
probably wondering why I don't use PDFTeX.  I am a bit of a purist and I
would rather use TeX unmodified as Donald Knuth left it.
You can get it from

    http://odo.kettering.edu/dvipdfm

or if you prefer FTP:

    ftp://ftp.kettering.edu/pub/outgoing/mwicks/dvipdfm
    

   Features:
      - TeX \special's that approximate the functionality 
        of the PostScript pdfmarks used by Adobe's
	Acrobat Distiller.  Links, outlines, articles, and named
	destinations are supported, for example.
	
      - Ability to include PDF files and JPEG files
        as embedded images.

      - Beginning of page (BOP) and end of page (EOP)
        \special's for placing arbitrary PDF stream
	graphics on every page.

      - A color stack accessible via \special's.
	
      - Works great on plain old DVI files.

   Limitations (at present):

      - No Virtual font support in this version. This means that the
	"times", "palatino", and similar packages that require virtual
	fonts will not work correctly.  Virtual font support is in
	progress and this should be supported soon. 

      - No output PDF stream compression.  Input PDF files
        may be contain compressed streams, however.
        Flate compression of PDF output streams will be
	supported in a future version.
	
      - No package support yet.  Graphics can be included
        via \special's, but there is no higher level macro
	support.  There is no interfacet for \includegraphics,
	for example.  Rotation isn't implemented yet.
	This should be easy to implement for included figures
	and will be added soon.
	
      - This code is in its infancy.  It has worked flawlessly
        for me, but YMMV.
