   This is dvipdfm, a DVI to PDF translator.  I wrote this mainly as
exercise to get at the features of PDF I wanted to experiment with. You're
probably wondering why I don't use PDFTeX.  I am a bit of a purist and I
would rather use TeX unmodified as Donald Knuth left it.
You can get it or the manual from

    http://odo.kettering.edu/dvipdfm

or if you prefer FTP:

   Features:
      - TeX \special's that approximate the functionality 
        of the PostScript pdfmarks used by Adobe's
	Acrobat Distiller.  Links, outlines, articles, and named
	destinations are supported, for example.
	
      - Ability to include PDF files and JPEG files
        as embedded images.  For PDF files, only the first
        page is included.  Resources will be embedded from
	the original file as necessary.  File inclusion
	does not work for PDF files that store the page
	contents in several segments in an array.
	
      - Support for arbitrary linear graphics transformations.
        Any material on the page can be scaled and rotated.

      - A color stack accessible via \special's.

      - Beginning of page (BOP) and end of page (EOP)
        \special's for placing arbitrary PDF stream
	graphics on every page.
	
      - Works great on plain old DVI files.

   Limitations (at present):

      - No Virtual font support in this version. This means that the
	"times", "palatino", and similar packages that require virtual
	fonts will not work correctly.  Virtual font support is in
	progress and this should be supported soon. 

      - No output PDF stream compression.  Input PDF files
        may be contain compressed streams, however.
        Flate compression of PDF output streams will be
	supported in a future version.
	
      - No package support yet.  Graphics can be included
        via \special's, but there is no higher level macro
	support.  There is no interfacet for \includegraphics,
	for example.  Rotation isn't implemented yet.
	This should be easy to implement for included figures
	and will be added soon.
	
      - Second generation and linearized PDF files can't
        be encapsulated as graphic images.
	
      - This code is in its infancy.  It has worked flawlessly
        for me, but YMMV.
