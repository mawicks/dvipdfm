# Dvipdfm
This is dvipdfm, a DVI to PDF translator.

I originally wrote this so I could
experiment with features of PDF in TeX.

This is the original dvipdfm project with commit history.
The project was not originally started in Git and has been migrated through several tools.

I no longer develop or support dvipdfm.  If you want a modern verion of dvipdfm, you probably want http://project.ktug.org/dvipdfmx/ which is a derivative work.
