Installation:

   To compile and install this package, you need the standard TeX (texk)
source tree.  Specifically, you need kpathsea along with its make/autoconf
directories. 
   
   1.  Unbundle the gzip'ed tar file inside the texk toplevel directory.
   2.  Type "./configure" in the dvipdfm directory along with 
       any necessary options, e.g., "--prefix=PATH".
   3.  Type "make" in the dvipdfm directory.
   4.  If all goes well, type "make install" in the dvipdfm directory.
   
   I have installed this cleanly on Solaris 2.5 and RedHat Linux 5.1.
I have been using it primarily under Linux.

Notes/Possible Problems:

   1.  The Makefile installs the "dvipdfm" and the "ebb" binaries.
       The dvipdfm binary requries kpathsea to do its font searching.
       You must already have a working TeX installation with its own
       texmf.cnf, etc.

   2.  In addition to this package, you will need PostScript Type1 fonts for
       the Computer Modern fonts and any additional fonts you want to use.
       PostScript Type1 fonts are distributed by the American Math Society.
       Information about these fonts is available at the URL

       http://www.ams.org/tex/type1-fonts.html

       and the fonts themselves (Computer Modern and AMS fonts) are available at

         ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/psfonts/

       These fonts need to be installed in a location where the kpathsea
       library can find them.

   3.  If "dvipdfm" complains that it can't find fonts, read the "kpathsea"
       documentation about debugging path searching.  If you can't get
       kpathsea to find your texmf tree, it can always locate the
       fonts using environment variables.  If "kpathsea" can't find
       your texmf.cnf, try setting the environment variable TEXMFCNF
       to point to the directory containing texmf.cnf.  As an
       alternative, you can set AFMFONTS to point to your ".afm" files
       (dvipdfm needs these), set T1FONTS to point to your ".pfb" files,
       and set TFMFONTS to point to your ".tfm" files.
