   Version 0.10.5 changes the rule code to use a PDF stroke instead
of filling a rectangular box.  It also omits some unecessary
font information from the PDF file for the base 14 PS fonts.
This is to produce for slightly smaller PDF files when using
these fonts.

   NOTE: VERSION 0.10.4 CHANGES THE NAME/LOCATION OF ITS CONFIGURATION FILES!

   It also fixes a bug that caused nested virtual fonts to fail and fixes a couple of other
   fairly insignificant bugs.

   Version 0.10.0 introduced PK fonts support and support
   for TPIC special commands to allow some native graphics
   support (don't you hate distilling those .eps files).

   Version 0.9.0 supports partial font embedding and Flate compression. The
   page tree and destination tree are shipped out as balanced trees.

December 14, 1998.
   Version 0.8.3 fixes a memory leak in the vf code found by Akiro Kakuto.
   Another change hopefully makes running ./configure a bit easier.

   Version 0.8.1 and 0.8.2 fix an overflow in the kerning code
   which occurs for large horizontal motions.

   Version 0.8 supports virtual fonts.  Much of the code has been
   reorganized and rewritten.  It is nearly an order of magnitude faster than
   earlier versions.  Version 0.8 no longer requires the kpath source
   tree.  Instead it uses an installed version of libkpathsea and its
   headers.

Nov. 28, 1998
   Specifying font encoding now supported.  There is a font map file for
   the more common PostScript fonts.

   LaTeX Graphics and hyperref support is now available. See the directory
   latex-support for information and drivers.
