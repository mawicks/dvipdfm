   Version 0.8.3 fixes a memory leak in the vf code found by
Akiro Kakuto and hopefully makes running ./configure a bit easier.

   Version 0.8.1 and 0.8.2 fix an overflow in the kerning code
which occurs for large horizontal motions.

   Version 0.8 supports virtual fonts.  Much of the code has been
reorganized and rewritten.  It is nearly an order of magnitude faster than
earlier versions.  Version 0.8 no longer requires the kpath source
tree.  Instead it uses an installed version of libkpathsea and its
headers.

   Encoding support now works.  There is a font map file for
the more common PostScript fonts.
