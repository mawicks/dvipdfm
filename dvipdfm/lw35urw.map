%
% Format is as follows:
% TeX-name encoding AFM-name PFB-name
% The default behavior is to use the font's built-in
% encoding, to use the TeX-name as the AFM-name, and
% to use the AFM-name as the PFB-name.
% The word "default" may be used in any field to
% specify the default behavior. You can
% also say "none", in the PFB field, for example
% to say that no PFB should be loaded
