\section{Introduction}
This document is primarily intended
to demonstrate the functionality
of some \LaTeX packages that require
driver support for their functionality.
It is quick-and-dirty.
It is not intended to be pretty, and
does not demonstrate good ways to use these packages
(In fact, it demonstrates some bad ways to use these packages).

\section{LaTeX Support Information}
Dvipdfm support for the hyperref \LaTeX\space package is 
in hyperref versions 6.44 (12/07/98) and above, available on CTAN.
Dvipdfm is now supported in the
standard \LaTeX\space release (via the ``color'' and ``graphics'' packages) in
\LaTeX\space releases dated later than December 1998.

If you have an older LaTeX and don't want to upgrade,
this distribution of {\tt dvipdfm} includes
the {\tt .def} files required to support
the \textcolor{green}{color},
\rotatebox{30}{\textcolor{red}{graphics}} package.
You may also need to modify {\tt color.sty}, {\tt graphics.sty},
and {\tt hyperref.sty} so that they
recognize {\tt dvipdfm} as a driver.
Once these {\tt .def} files are installed,
you should be able to use {\tt dvipdfm}
with \LaTeX for many applications.

After running \LaTeX on this
document, {\tt hyperref}
should produce a hyperlinked
document, complete with an outline.

\section{Graphics Support}
Currently, JPEG and PDF image
inclusion are supported.

\subsection{JPEG Image Inclusion}
Figure~\ref{fig:author}
shows a photograph of the author
that was obtained from a JPEG file.
A small file with the extension of {\tt .bb}
supplies the bounding box to the \LaTeX\space
Graphics package.  For PDF and JPEG files,
this bounding box can easily be created by running
the {\tt ebb} utility included with this
distribution of {\tt dvipdfm}.

\subsection{PDF Image Inclusion}
Figure~\ref{fig:circuit} shows
an electronics circuit,
drawn with XFig, distilled,
and then included as PDF file.
